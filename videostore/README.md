# Video store

Fork from Uncle Bob's `videostore` repository, that supports Maven.

There are the following branches:

- `master`: The to-be-refactored state.  Make a branch from here and try your own refactoring.
- `bob-solution`: Uncle Bob's solution, that he showed in Clean Code video 3 (functions).
